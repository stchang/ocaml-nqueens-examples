For non-regular ocaml users, here are directions to run the examples:
(tested with OCaml version 4.00.0)

(* to avoid stack overflow error for eager nqueens 8 *)
export OCAMLRUNPARAM=l=100M

- from cmd line:
ocamlc nqueens_eager.ml
time ocamlrun a.out

OR

- to load in interpreter:
#use "nqueens_eager.ml";;
(the # is part of the #use directive and is not the same as the # prompt)
